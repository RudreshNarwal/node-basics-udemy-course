call stack -> 
The job of the call stack is to track the execution of our program and
 it does that by keeping track of all of the functions that are currently
  running.


main() -> 
  The main function gets pushed onto the call stack dropping all the way 
  to the bottom since there's nothing

Node API -> 
  event gets registered in node API (for async function)


Callback queue-> 
So when a given event is done in this case when the zero 
second timer is complete that callback function

Event loop -> 
 event loop looks at two things it looks at the
 call stack and it looks at the callback Q If the call stack 
is empty it's going to run items from the callback Q
